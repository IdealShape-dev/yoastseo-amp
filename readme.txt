This plugin makes sure the default WordPress AMP plugin uses the proper Yoast SEO metadata.

== Description ==

This plugin makes sure the default [WordPress AMP plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/) uses the proper [Yoast SEO](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/) metadata. Without this glue plugin things like canonical might go wrong.

This replaces the following values with Yoast SEO data, all in the JSON+LD data on posts:

* Organization name (uses the blog name by default, now replaced by the Company name from the SEO General settings, Your info tab)
* Organization logo (uses the blog icon by default, now replaced by the Company logo from the SEO General settings, Your info tab)
* Post canonical (replaced by the Yoast SEO canonical, usually the same but makes sure its consistent when changed through Yoast SEO)
* Post image (uses the featured image by default, replaced by the Facebook image if one is set)
* Post description (added from the meta description, if set, by default the WordPress AMP plugin doesn't add one)

> *Bugs? Ideas?*<br>
